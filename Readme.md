## Complete Face Recovery GAN: Unsupervised Joint Face Rotation and De-Occlusion from a Single-View Image
Below images are frontalization and de-occlusion results. The first rows are the input images and the second rows are our results. We crop the results as alignments for input images of facial recognition networks.

The codes implemented for Swap-R&R and CFR-GAN will be updated later.
